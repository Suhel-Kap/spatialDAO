# spatialDAO

SpatialDAO is a platform that allows organizations to create and monetize their own dataDAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) using the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM). Organizations can propose files, which are then voted on by DAO members to determine their importance. Bounties can be created to fund the storage of approved files, and deal clients in the Filecoin ecosystem can search for and claim these bounties to get rewarded. The platform also features a social layer built on the Orbis protocol, that is woking on top of the Ceramic network **which is utializing the libp2p protocol**! The social layer allows organizations to explore proposals and bounties, and communicate with other interested DAO members.
